# Mailmap
# Developers may want or might be forced to commit from registered business email with particular name.
# Such practice both nicely aligned and enforced at the same time when commit required to be signed with GPG key (`-S` flag).
# Developers are expected whether on their own willing or because of aforementioned practice to:
#   1. Add historical overrides to fix mistakes made in Git config.
#   2. Add override in case somehow, again, committed wrong annotations.

## Blocks of entries sorted in alphabetical order.
## Most precise overrides should go first as ant-paths and such, where first match wins.

### Block contains overrides for both name and email.



### Block contains overrides for email only.



### Block contains overrides for name only.
